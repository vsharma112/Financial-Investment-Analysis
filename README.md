# Investment Portfolio Performance Analysis | Multi-Currency & Broker Insights

📈 Investment Portfolio Performance Analysis

This project looks at real-world investment data to understand how a portfolio performs across different asset types, brokers, currencies, and dates. It focuses on simple but meaningful metrics like invested amount, current value, and return rate to show what is working and what is not. The analysis compares investment types, tracks performance over time, and evaluates broker-wise results to highlight patterns and risks. Visual dashboards clearly show differences between invested and current values and overall returns. This project reflects hands-on data analysis, financial understanding, and the ability to turn raw data into clear, business-friendly insights for real world decision making.

* Calculated Fields – Developed custom metrics such as profit/loss, return categories, and performance indicators using Tableau calculations.
* Filters & Parameters – Implemented dynamic filters and parameters to allow users to explore data by investment type, broker, currency, and status.
